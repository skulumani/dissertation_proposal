## Dependencies

Make sure you set your `texmf` tree using the files from

[Github `texmf`](https://github.com/skulumani/texmf) or [Bitbucket `texmf`](https://bitbucket.org/shankarkulumani/texmf)

This is specifically using `presentation_packages.sty`

## Submodule

Also, this uses a `git submodule` to pull in `figures/timeline` graphic.
Go into `figures/timeline` and run `git pull` to get updates from [timeline](https://github.com/skulumani/timeline).

If you have to make updates to the timeline graphic, make sure you do it in that repo and then update this one.
