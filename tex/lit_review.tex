\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Low-thrust manuevers}
    
    orbital manuevers tend to focus on impulsive assumption

    optimization problems usually solved using direct methods

    long-durations require accurate numerical propogation techniques - typical runge kutta methods are prone to energy variances

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Spacecraft operations around asteroids}
    gravity model of asteroids usually truncacted/approximated

    typically ignore the attitude dynamics

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Constrained Attitude Control}
    
Usually use optimization/path planning approaches which are computationally intensive

Frequently use attitude paramterizations
